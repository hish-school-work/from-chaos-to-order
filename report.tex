\begin{abstract}
In this paper, I aim to explore the fascinating connection between Chaos Theory and Fractal Geometry in nature. By providing a clear overview of these mathematical concepts, I'll investigate how they can explain the complex patterns we see in coastlines, trees, and mountains. This research aims to demonstrate the incredible power of mathematics to understand the complexities of the natural world. It shows how, paradoxically, chaos can lead to order.

\subsection{What is Chaos Theory?}
Chaos Theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. This phenomenon is popularly referred to as the butterfly effect.
