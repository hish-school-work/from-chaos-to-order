\begin{abstract}
This paper is the result of my burning curiosity about Chaos Theory and Fractals and acts as an introduction to both, in hopes that it sparks some curiosity for you as well. I aim to explore the fascinating connection between Chaos Theory and Fractal Geometry in nature. 

I will begin by providing the background you will need to understand the mathematics involved to follow along. Then, I will demonstrate the incredible power of mathematics to understand the complexities of the natural world, illustrated by the complex patterns we see in coastlines, trees, and mountains. I will conclude the paper with some philosophical insights—that there is no order without chaos—and two perspectives to consider when reflecting on the unpredictable beauty of nature.

\section{Chaos Theory}
\subsection{What is Chaos Theory?}
Chaos Theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. This phenomenon is popularly referred to as the butterfly effect.
