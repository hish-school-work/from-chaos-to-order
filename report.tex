\begin{abstract}
In this paper, I aim to explore the relationship between Chaos Theory and Fractal Geometry in nature. By providing a comprehensive overview of chaos theory and fractal geometry, the paper investigates mathematical models that can explain the complex patterns observed in nature, such as coastlines, trees, and mountains. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical mathematics and real-world applications, demonstrating how chaos can give rise to order.

\subsection{What is Chaos Theory?}
Chaos Theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. This phenomenon is popularly referred to as the butterfly effect.
