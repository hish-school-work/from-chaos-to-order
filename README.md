# STAT/MATH 900 - Capstone
My capstone project for my graduate degree (UofA MDP). 

## From Chaos to Order
The project report explores Fractal geometry by starting from fundamentals of Chaos Theory. Chaos Theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.
